This directory contains assets, pages for interactive illustrations for iframe purpose.

### To submit
1. We prefer to host interactive illustrations by ourselves.

### Visual Illustration Guidelines
- Full screen "canvas" with no margin and padding
- Works on mobile, responsive design and could detect touch events
- You will be credited in the author section, figure descriptions and ARIA tags, so please try to avoid credits in your sketch. 


### Guidelines
Right now we don't have a guideline for other illustrations with Audio, microphone, inputing code, webcams or other browser APIs, we will need talk in person.
